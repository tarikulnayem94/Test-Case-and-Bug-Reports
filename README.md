# 🧪 About the Project : &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<br> <br>
This project focuses on writing and executing test cases for the futurenation web application. The goal is to ensure these features function correctly and reliably under different conditions.
<br> <br>

# ✅ Pre-requisites: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<br> <br>

Microsoft Excel (used for documenting test cases and bug reports)
<br> 
<br>
# 🧾 What is a Test Case? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<br> <br>

A test case is a documented set of actions, inputs, and expected results designed to verify a particular feature or functionality of a software application. If a test case fails, it often indicates a defect that needs investigation and resolution.
<br>
# 💡 Why Test Cases Matter &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<br><br>
Ensure all features meet functional requirements
<br>

  
1. Validate system behavior under different scenarios  
2. Improve software quality and reliability 
3. Help uncover hidden defects early in the development cycle
